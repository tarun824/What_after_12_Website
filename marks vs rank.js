At confusing times like these, trusting only your intuition may not be the right way to go.<br>\ <br>\Students may think about dropping out for a few reasons like – they feel that their performance was not their best and that they could have possibly done better, or for the mere reason of giving the entrance examinations a second time in order to get into the top institutes. We take in all these factors and discuss the pros and cons of dropping out. Read on!";
    document.getElementById("head3").innerHTML="Pros";
    document.getElementById("headsub2").innerHTML="<b>\Revisit your preparation</b>\<br>\Governed by the basic idea of improvement, students who take a drop get an opportunity to revisit their preparation and fix the loopholes in their preparation. This especially comes in handy for students for whom two years were not sufficient enough, which is usually the case owing to the excessive syllabus. Not only do you get a second shot at preparation, you get to learn from your performance in the examination you already appeared for.<br>\<br>\<b>\An achievable future</b>\<br>\A considerable rank in the previous exam gives students a short term goal that a slight improvement in their performance can effectively change their rank in the positive direction. Once you have seen what amount of effort bears you what rank, you work towards improving it and achieve your desired rank!<br>\<br>\<b>\Don’t compromise</b>\<br>\Instead of compromising for a college of lower potential, students who are confident in their capabilities, get a chance to get into the top institutes, thus changing the course of their future. If you are sure and confident of your passion and capabilities, one extra year of effort won’t matter if it means getting into the top institute." ;
    document.getElementById("head4").innerHTML="Cons of taking a drop:";
    document.getElementById("headsub3").innerHTML="<b>\An extra year</b>\<br>\Taking a drop means studying for an extra year, the same concepts and preparation all over again. This can be extremely stressful for many, especially after the last time didn’t give you desirable results. Also, students who aspire to pursue further education such as an MBA or maybe even a Ph.D., can’t afford to waste extra years for their preparation, especially those in the medical field. In such a situation, an extra year can turn out to be quite taxing.<br>\<br>\<b>\Performance pressure</b>\<br>\Due to the unsatisfactory performance in the previous year, candidates tend to be under a huge pressure to outperform themselves, else the extra year may seem like a waste of their time and effort. Often this stress gets to the head of students and they turn out to be poorer performers. However, it is completely up to you how you steer the pressure and keep yourself motivated.<br>\<br>\<b>\The stakes</b>\<br>\Often students believe that they can improve their current rank after taking a drop, but another year of strenuous preparation puts them through a lot of stress and often they are discouraged, frustrated, depressed and sometimes simply bored. This leads them to score even lower than expected. This has been observed to be happening to a significant number of the people who take a drop. This can primarily also be due to the reason that a lot is at stake as this time will be the ultimate chance and failing it would mean a worse path for your future";
    document.getElementById("head5").innerHTML="Conclusion";
    document.getElementById("ul1").innerHTML="<ul>\
    <li>Take a drop only if you are motivated enough, and especially if you are sure that the current performance was not your best. If a tiny part of you feels that you could not have done any better, taking a drop is a sure no.</li>\
    <li>I would also advise against taking up a college and preparing for an entrance exam at the same time. You don’t want to bite off more than you can chew.</li>\
    <li>If confident enough, take a drop keeping in mind that a year of strenuous preparation awaits you. However, there’s no reason to worry, it’s not that tough. Some of us are just wired better than others.</li>\

However, every cloud has a silver lining, and dropping a year is no exception.<br>\<br>\When I couldn’t get into the IITs the first time I gave the JEE Advanced exam, needless to say, I was very disappointed. However, I took up the idea of dropping a year and studying again as it was my dream to get into the IITs. What followed in the next one year was not easy,but there were also many awesome things which I did apart from studies.";
    document.getElementById("head3").innerHTML="To-do things in the drop year:";
    document.getElementById("headsub2").innerHTML="With no pressure of board exams or that of school exams, I could focus my attention wholly on preparing for the JEE exams. As a result, I got quite some free time for indulging myself in other activities.<br>\<br>\The first thing I did was learn how to play a guitar. You may try and learn any musical instrument but take care that it doesn’t eat up too much of your preparation time. Learning music not only refreshes your mind but it also keeps away negative thoughts and helps to keep a healthy mental state, which aids in your preparation. Though I didn’t master it completely, yet three to four hours a week for quite some time helped me learn about the basics of guitar.<br>\<br>\Apart from learning musical instruments, people also try out meditation. Meditation is a great and effective way of reducing tension. It helps lower blood pressure level and improves concentration level. Studying for any competitive exam can be tough, especially with very less friends to bank upon, and it can put immense stress on oneself. However, a few minutes of meditation refreshes and rejuvenates oneself and is very helpful in such times.<br>\<br>\Moreover, I explored Facebook and came to know of students who were droppers like myself. We gave each other inspiration. We even formed a group where we solved each other’s problems and numericals which someone could not solve or explained concepts which someone had difficulty understanding. Thus a group of people from different parts of India who had no idea about each other a few days back became partners in clearing one of the toughest examinations in the country. However, we also ensured that we did not spend too much time on Facebook and only used it as a means to solve our doubts.<br>\<br>\Apart from these, I love reading and nothing can come close to my joy of reading books. Although I could not fulfill my crave for reading books during that year, yet I made sure that I did not completely ignore it. Once or twice a month, I used to reward myself with a book. From novels to fiction, I spent my leisure time surrounded by mysteries and thrilling stories and it was definitely a good time when I was immersed in them.<br>\<br>\Thus, pursuing your hobby is definitely one the things you can do when you drop a year. However, you must take utmost care that you do not spend too much time on it – in college you will get plenty of opportunities to hone your skills or pursue your hobby. However, getting involved in some useful activities is definitely helpful than whiling away your time in social media. It helps you take a break from the monotonous studies and also prevent any negative thoughts from creeping into your mind. Thus,there are many awesome things to do in a drop year, and you should definitely try out some of them in your free time.";

Any distraction in the gap year may prove to be detrimental<br>\<br>\After finishing her class XII, Tanya Kapoor decided to drop a year to prepare for the NEET. She felt her preparation was not upto the mark as her time was mainly consumed in preparing for class XII boards. After much deliberation, she decided to take a break, instead of enrolling in any graduation course, she diligently studied for the entrance to get into a medical college. Tanya was among the few who cracked the entrance. Thousands of students each year drop a year or two to prepare for JEE, NEET, NID or UCEED. Only a few, with complete dedication succeed, after battling the peer pressure, watching fellow students going to the college, nagging parents and at times pressure and depression that may come along with the grind.";
    document.getElementById("headsub2").innerHTML="Every year, students face the dilemma of whether they should settle for what is available in hand or take a break to work for a dream rank. There is no right or wrong when it comes to deciding on a gap year as it depends on one's focus and determination.<br>\<br>\If a student is absolutely certain of pursuing only a particular field and is unable to get admitted to an institution of his choice, taking time to prepare and get into a stream and college of their choice is recommended, says Ganesh Kohli, IC3 conference chair, International Career and College Counseling Conference.<br>\<br>\In some cases, students who have prepared well, fail to perform due to maybe health issues or other reasons, can wait for another attempt. However, if one is not sure of the preparation, taking a year off may not make much of a difference, says Jagadeesh Kumar, dean, academic affairs, IIT-Madras<br>\<br>\Instead of wasting a year, the students should take the next best option. We must realise that an IIT degree only is not the assurance for success, says Kumar. He adds that when it comes to dropping a year to take a competitive exam, only students who scored well in the previous attempt but could not get their desired college should wait for a year to appear again.";
    document.getElementById("head4").innerHTML="<b>ROADBLOCKS</b>";
    document.getElementById("headsub3").innerHTML="The biggest roadblock students face during their drop year is a dip in motivation, says Ganesh Kohli, The lack of school routine, absence of family support, or sufficient guidance may lead to students slacking off. In some cases, they may even become gloomy and depressed.<br>\<br>\More students are taking time to decide where they want to end up. For the most part, my observation is that gap years have helped students. They have a greater probability of success with a well-planned gap year after class XII, says Kohli, adding how several students reap fruits of patient waiting and preparing for a year<br>\<br>\Ambika Kaul, an education and career counsellor with DPS, RK Puram, Delhi, agrees that if the student is disciplined and is ready to devote that extra time to achieve the goal, gap year can be a viable option. This should not be perceived as a risk.<br>\<br>\<b>GAP YEARS CAN BE TRANSFORMATIONAL</b>\<br>\Students who are not clear about their career or higher education choices can also use a gap year to explore some of their interests. They need to start with self-exploration, adds Kaul.<br>\<br>\Such students should take advantage of the psychometric tests available online that can help you map your skills and interests. They can also seek professional help and talk to people in some of the industries they are inclined towards, says Kaul.<br>\<br>\<b>USE THIS TIME TO BUILD YOUR PROFILE</b>\<br>\A gap year can be very useful for students planning to study abroad as they can use this time to build a holistic profile, which is highly favoured during admissions to good colleges abroad.<br>\<br>\There are many institutes that offer a gap year programme in the US and other countries but there are none in India. These programmes help students explore their strengths and an insight into the real-world workplaces in a structured manner. Such programmes help students meet their mentors and industry experts. <br>\<br>\K-12 education in India does not offer enough opportunities for students to identify their interests. As a result, many remain indecisive of their career choice or follow their peers and take up traditional pursuits such as engineering or medicine, only to realise later that their interest lies elsewhere, says Sahil Aggarwal, co-founder and CEO of Rishihood University, Haryana, which will launch the first gap year programme in India.<br>\<br>\<b>DRAWBACKS</b><br>\Given that college admissions are getting increasingly competitive, the frenetic pressure on young adults today is enormous. Students taking a gap year should not stress as they watch their peers progress with academic achievements. For such situations, it is important that you have a support system in your family, mentor, and friends to keep you on the right track throughout the year.";
