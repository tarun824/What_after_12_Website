    <h2 id="about">B Tech (Bachelor of Technology) Overview</h2>
    <p>B Tech is the abridged form of Bachelor of Technology. It is a professional four-year undergraduate course that covers all the fields of engineering as well as technology. BTech is available in various specializations like BTech computer science (CSE), BTech Biotechnology engineering, BTech Information Technology engineering (IT), BTech mechanical engineering (ME), BTech electronics and communication engineering&nbsp; (ECE),&nbsp; BTech civil engineering (CE),&nbsp; BTech in electrical engineering (EE), etc. Apart from the core engineering field, B Tech allows candidates to work in the Information Technology, Data Analysis, Consultancy, and Management sectors. BTech graduates having good technical skills can also apply for jobs in the public sectors and various Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). B. Tech courses can be pursued in both online and offline modes.&nbsp; <br><br>The BTech course is designed for developing the technical skills of candidates who aim to invest themselves in the core technology and development industry of our economy. It comprises both workings of theoretical and practical knowledge of an individual. Students are offered admission on the basis of state level, national level, and university level entrance exams such as JEE Main, WBJEE, BITSAT, KLEEE, AP EAMCET, and JEE Advanced (applicable only for IITs), etc.&nbsp;</p>
