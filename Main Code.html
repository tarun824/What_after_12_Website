                <p>
                ‘What after 12th ?’ is the common question among the generation of students studying in
                12th standard. Every year the questions hit lakhs of students in India and abroad. The confusion
                prevails among them concerning career prospects, job opportunities and yes, their passion, their
                preference. Counselors say that the lack of proper information about the courses available in
                India and their career prospects, is somewhere responsible. Science, Commerce and Arts are the
                options available in which students can find a suitable course to pursue after 12th.
                Choosing a course shall never be a convenient option rather it should be a highly motivating choice
                for the students. Interests, motivation, and goals are prime factors students must consider while
                choosing a course from the range of courses available in India to pursue after 12th. Students can
                choose a course from top domains including Engineering, Architecture, Design, Law, Applied
                Science, Business Studies, Management, Behavioral and Social Sciences, Economics, Media,
